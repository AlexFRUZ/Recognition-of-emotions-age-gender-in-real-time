@ufcpride40: : Terry Bean, prominent gay activist and MAJOR Obama and Dem donor indicted for child rape. Surprised? POTUS? What a Joke.
#TWEET !!! RT @Mastos_TM: Same way you don't find the death jokes funny, some people didn't find your Rape, Aids, Gay etc. jokes funny..
if you call women “bitches” or “females”, i’m automatically gonna assume you’re a misogynist idc if you’re a woman either, we don’t do that here.
tea but all I’m sayin is gay jokes or rape jokes (etc) aren’t jokes .........
Okay but these are the exact people who got Vic fired for the exact same thing they’re doing. He made a harmless jellybean joke and got fired because it wasn't acceptable. These people are making rape, incest, and gay jokes, yet it's acceptable? Take a seat, young Skywalker. https://twitter.com/DragonBallBLK/status/1167515746676760579
@Mr_Fanta_Pants: How long until Kat heats up her crack pipe over the BBQ? #MKR think she already has, crazy bitch
I think I would have just liked the OJ stories. All the rape joke/gay superhero shit made me switch the fuck off.
@LeoKikiLady89 I respect your use of Sprinkles Are For Winners.
I just don't understand why being depressed/suicidal is glorified, gay is used as an insult, and rape" is either a fabrication or a joke
