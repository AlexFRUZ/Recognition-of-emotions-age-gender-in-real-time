Sorry, bas no.. Yes racism is typically against colored people, bas if u were to treat them worse for their color, that'd be racist too. Raverse racism isn't an issue tab3an, doesn't exist irl to my knowledge. Doesn't mean being racist is ok law towards w. people tho.. 1/2 https://twitter.com/LuceXcherry/status/1275906692044197889
